# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Deep-Learning

First project of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Trained a deep neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikes shared for a bike sharing company. Implemented forward, backward propagation and adjusted the hyperparameters to get the best predictions.

The repository contains a file called 'Detailed Report.md' which is the detailed file from the Udacity project that explains the project and also contains the code to make it running.

The file 'neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb' is the original notebook of the project.

# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Deep-Learning
First project of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Trained a deep neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikes shared for a bike sharing company. Implemented forward, backward propagation and adjusted the hyperparameters to get the best predictions.
